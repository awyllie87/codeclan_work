```


## Data Investigation
<br>
**Question 1.**  
Read the files "actors.csv", "movies.csv" and "roles.csv" into R.  You might get warnings here - don't worry the data is okay for what we are trying to do.



<br>

**Question 2.**

* What are the primary keys and the foreign keys for each data frame?
* What kind of relationship (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) is there between
  * actors and roles
  * movies and roles
  * actors and movies

Write these as comments/text in your R Notebook.

## Little Mermaid, The

**Question 1.**  
From the movies table, find the id of the film The Little Mermaid. (In the data as "Little Mermaid, The").

<br>

**Question 2.**  
Filter the roles data frame, so we just have roles from the Little Mermaid (hint: use the ID you found in the last question). Save the result as `little_mermaid_roles`.

<br>

**Question 3.**  
Carry out a left join on this new data frame and the actors data frame, to find the actors which appeared in The Little Mermaid.

<br>

**Question 4.**  
Do the last join, but with an inner join instead. Is the data different? Why is that?

<br>

## Actors in more than one film

**Question 1.**  
For all actors who have appeared in at least two films. Call this data frame `actors_more_than_once`.

<br>

**Question 2.**  
Left join `actors_more_than_once` to `roles`, so we can see all the actors roles those actors played in. 

<br>

**Question 3.**  
Left join the result from above to movies, so we can see details of each movie for these roles


**Question 4.**  
For each actor, find the average rating of the films they appeared. Find the five actors with the highest average rank of films they appeared in.

## The Busiest Actor

**Question 1.**  
Find the actor who has appeared in most films. List the films they appeared in, the year the film was released and their role in the film.

### Q2

actors --
primary key == id
actor - role = 1 to 1
actor - movie = 1 to Many

movies --
primary key == id
movie - role = 1 to Many
movie - actor = 1 to many

roles --
primary key == none
foreign key ==  actor_id
                movie_id
                
## Little Mermaid, The

```{r}

#Q1

movies %>% 
  filter(name == "Little Mermaid, The")

#Q2

little_mermaid_roles <- roles %>% 
  filter(movie_id == 192017)

#Q3

little_mermaid_roles %>% 
  left_join(actors, c("actor_id" = "id"))

#Q4

little_mermaid_roles %>% 
  inner_join(actors, c("actor_id" = "id"))
```
