# codeclan_work

A working history of what I'm doing during my class hours at [CodeClan](https://codeclan.com/). Will be cool to have a day to day history of my time on their [Data Analysis](https://codeclan.com/courses/data-analysis/) course.

This is purely for my benefit to get used to regular git commits and as a little historical artifact for myself. Feel free to wander through it if you're curious, but it isn't meant to be instructive for anyone besides myself.
